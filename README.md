The Idea is to make an Android App that can Notify the User to apply for the Job, Exam or Internship.

What We need to Do ?

1. Web Scraper - To Scrap latest jobs, exams and internships from verified websites.
2. Firebase Database - To Store all the information.
3. Android App - To Fetch and Display the information.

3. Under Home Screen -
    1. Carousel at Top with 5 images with some informations.
    2. Categories - Internship, Jobs, Exams.
